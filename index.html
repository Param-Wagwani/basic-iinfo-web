    <p> <h3>Development</h3></p>
      <p>  Starlink was publicly announced in January 2015 with the opening of the SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington. During the opening, Elon Musk stated there is still significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilitiesand that Starlink would target bandwidth to carry up to 50% of all backhaul communications traffic, and up to 10% of local Internet traffic, in high-density cities.Elon further stated that the positive cash flow from selling satellite internet services would be necessary to fund their Mars plans.Furthermore, SpaceX has long-term plans to develop and deploy a version of the satellite communication system to serve Mars </p>
        <p> <h3>Services</h3>
            Starlink provides satellite internet connectivity to underserved areas of the planet, as well as competitively priced service in more urbanized areas.</p>

          <p>  In the United States, Starlink charges a one-time hardware fee of $599 for a user terminal and $110 per month for internet service at a fixed service address location. An additional $25 per month allows the user terminal to move beyond a fixed location (Starlink For RVs) but with service speeds deprioritized compared to the fixed users in that area.Fixed users are told to expect typical throughput of "50 Mbps to 150 Mbps and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms". A higher performance version of the service (Starlink Business) advertises speeds of 150 to 500 Mbps for a higher cost of $2,500 for the user terminal and a $500 monthly service fee. Another service called Starlink Maritime became available in July 2022 providing internet access on the open ocean, with speeds of 350 Mbps after purchasing a maritime-grade $10,000 user terminal and for a $5,000 monthly service fee.</p>s
            
          <p>  Sales are capped to a few hundred fixed users per 20 km "service cell area" due to limited wireless capacity. Starlink alternatively offers a Best Effort service tier allowing homes in capped areas to receive the current unused bandwidth of their cell while they are on the waiting list for more prioritized service. The price and equipment are the same as the residential service at $110 per month. To improve the service quality in densely populated areas, Starlink introduced a monthly 1TB data cap for all non-business users which became enforced in 2023.</p>
            
          <p>  In August 2022 SpaceX lowered monthly service costs for users in select countries.[102] For example, users in Brazil and Chile saw monthly fee decreases of about 50%.</p>
            
            <p>As of December 2022, Starlink has over one million active subscribers.</p>
